ilearnedtoprogram.com
---------------------
In 2011, I made a website, ilearnedtoprogram.com (now defunct), so
there would be a place to read and share very short stories about learning to
program.

Some thoughts about the motivation, process, and outcomes:

* <a href="http://itmoves.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/how-did-you-learn-to-program/">How did you learn to program?</a>
* <a href="http://itmoves.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/having-10000-people-over/">Having 10,000 People Over</a>
* <a href="http://itmoves.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/how-and-why-you-learned-to-program/">How and What You Learned to Program</a>

This article <a href="http://www.women2.org/ilearnedtoprogram-shows-cs-diversity/">Women 2.0: ILearnedToProgram Shows Computer Science Diversity</a> was a great affirmation of the intent of the project.

Computational Thinking Illustrated
----------------------------------
Computational Thinking is popular term in the
world of CS education, but when it first arose there was confusion about what it meant and
difficulty communicating that meaning to students. In collaboration with
illustrator <a href="http://glitchworks.com/">Tim Piotrowski</a>, I ran a
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/benchun/computational-thinking-illustrations">Kickstarter project</a>
to produce freely-available illustrations of Computational Thinking concepts.

Thanks to broad support from the CS education community, programmers, and
tech-savvy parents, it only took a few days for us to reach our funding goal.
The process of creating the illustrations and accompanying text took about six
months, and the site is live at <a href="http://ctillustrated.com">ctillustrated.com</a>.

I <a href="http://itmoves.wordpress.com/2011/05/02/computational-thinking-illustrations/">wrote on my teaching blog</a> about the inspiration and goals for the project. Some of the cartoons appeared in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2189835">June
2012 Issue of ACM Inroads</a>, illustrating an article by
<a href="http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~briggs/">Amy Briggs</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ola/">Owen Astrachan</a> entitled <em>The CS
Principles Project</em>.
